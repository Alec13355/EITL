## Welcome Back to EITL! 

### Update
I am back from parental leave and back to work! It was a great time with my family and I am excited to be back to work. I had an amazing time learning to be a first time dad to an awesome little boy, Teddy. However, I feel like I am a little out of the loop (pun intended) on AI and other tech news. So I am going to try to catch up on some of the news and share it with you here. I also feel like I haven't done the best job of keeping you all in the loop on what is going on in Ai or tech. So I am hoping to do that as well. 

This was made pretty clear to me when even in Omaha, NE I have had at least 2 companies reach out to me about AI roles and I thought to myself "I don't think we are really doing our readers/listeners justice on these topics", because if you listened to our podcast you could talk about an AI thing here and there, but not super deeply. So I'm hoping this daily format is a place I can continue to share smaller things and hopefully "Keep you in the loop".

#### Microsoft brings Anthropic AI models to 365 Copilot, diversifies beyond OpenAI
[Anthropic Joins Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/24/expanding-model-choice-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)

Microsoft added Anthropic’s Claude models to Microsoft 365 Copilot, letting enterprises choose Anthropic in addition to OpenAI models. This broadens Microsoft’s AI supplier base and reduces reliance on a single provider. This is making Microsoft the one stop shop for AI models!

Rolling out to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure’s model catalog, with standard Microsoft enterprise controls (compliance, audit, data residency) applied.

Anthropic models accessible via Azure AI Studio/Inference APIs with content filtering, prompt shields, and logging. Interop with existing plugins/connectors remains.

Comes amid rising enterprise demand for multiple foundation models and to mitigate vendor, outage, and policy risks while addressing safety/governance expectations.

#### Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 is available now - ‘the best AI model in the world for real-world agents, coding, and computer use’
[Claude Sonnet 4.5 Is Out!](https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/claude/anthropics-claude-sonnet-4-5-is-available-now-the-best-ai-model-in-the-world-for-real-world-agents-coding-and-computer-use)

Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5, their latest model with improved reasoning, speed, and safety. It's now the best model for real-world agents, coding, and computer use. They claim it's "the best AI model in the world for real-world agents, coding, and computer use". If this is true, then we are in for a treat!

If you haven't heard of computer use, it's a model that can use your computer's hardware to do things like code, write, and even use your computer's webcam and microphone. This might sound scary, but it's super cool because it allows you to use AI with software on your computer without requiring every vendor you have to build their own AI tools to use it. It also can help you centralize your AI costs since a lot of vendors are charging a premium for their AI tools.

#### Amazon unveils new generation of AI-powered Kindle and other devices

This is pretty cool as we are seeing more and more devices ship with AI. I am curious to see how our lives change as the barrier to AI keeps dropping!

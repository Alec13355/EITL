Clark's words echoed in my head: "Getting reps in is important. Try to do 100 things and keep getting better." It's a mantra I've been trying to internalize, especially when it comes to the podcast. And today, I got a surprisingly satisfying "rep" in, all while out of the house with just my iPhone, an RSS feed, and the power of AI.

## The Count

I was curious. How many episodes have we actually put out? It feels like a lot, but sometimes the numbers can surprise you. And true to Clark's advice, I wanted to find a quick, efficient way to get that count.

## The Tools

My tools were simple: my iPhone, the RSS feed for our podcast, and ChatGPT. I opened up ChatGPT and, without much preamble, asked it: "Can you help me get a count of episodes from this RSS feed?" I then pasted the URL of our podcast's RSS feed.

What came back was pretty amazing. ChatGPT, understanding the request, generated a curl command. For those unfamiliar, curl is a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. In this case, it was designed to fetch the RSS feed and then, with a bit of parsing, extract the number of <item> tags, which typically represent individual podcast episodes.

Now, here's where the magic of having a capable mobile setup came in. I didn't have my laptop, but I did have iSH installed on my iPhone. For those who don't know, iSH is a project that brings a Linux shell environment to iOS, allowing you to run various Linux tools directly on your iPhone. It's incredibly powerful for quick tasks and experimentation on the go.

I simply copied the curl command generated by ChatGPT, opened up iSH, pasted it into the terminal, and hit enter.

And there it was: 73 episodes.

Seventy-three! It's a great feeling to see that number. It signifies consistency, dedication, and a lot of conversations. And it brought me back to the "100 things" idea. Each episode is a "thing." Each one is a rep.

The beauty of this approach, and the "100 things" philosophy, is that it's not just about reaching a big number. It's about getting "just a little better each time." I thought back to our very first episode â€“ the audio quality, the pacing, the flow. There's a big difference between that initial foray and our latest release. That difference is the accumulation of 73 reps, 73 opportunities to learn, refine, and improve.

This little experiment with AI and iSH on my iPhone wasn't just about getting a count; it was a mini-validation of the "get your reps in" mindset. It showed me how accessible powerful tools can be, even when you're on the go. And it solidified the idea that every small effort, every "thing" you do, contributes to that larger goal of continuous improvement.

So, here's to 73 episodes, and here's to the journey to 100 and beyond. The reps are adding up, and we're getting better with every single one.

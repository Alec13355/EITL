    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h1>
    <p class="mb-8">Hey—I’m Alec, a builder at heart who happens to speak fluent cloud. ☁️ Based in Omaha, Nebraska 🏙️, I spend my days helping teams turn half-sketched ideas into production-ready apps on Azure, tackling the unglamorous problems that keep the on-call pager quiet. I also co-host Engineer in the Loop 🎙️, where we trade war stories about the messy, human side of AI and modern tooling.</p>
    <p class="mb-8">When I’m not designing resilient architectures or tinkering with new AI services, you’ll find me rallying the local tech scene—organizing and running developer user groups 🤝—or coaching devs through those “what just blew up?” moments. Off the clock, I’m usually queueing up “one more round” in the latest indie game 🎮, chasing Midwestern sunsets 🌅, or sneaking “just one more” feature into a side project.</p>
    <p class="mb-8">If you’re after someone who can bridge blue-sky ideas and real-world constraints—and have a little fun along the way—let’s talk. 💬</p>
